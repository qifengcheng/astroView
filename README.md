AstroView: Astronomical Object Viewing Library

Project Overview
AstroView is a Python-based astronomy toolkit that allows you to compute and visualize the positions of celestial objects (asteroids for now) with high precision. It leverages the Skyfield library, which provides “elegant astronomy for Python” and accurate ephemeris calculations, matching official almanac data to within 0.0005 arcseconds

This project is starting from scratch in the repository astroView, and our goal is to build a well-structured package with clear documentation and initial functionality for interactive use (e.g. in Jupyter notebooks).
